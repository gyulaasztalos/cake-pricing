# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Internal, staff-only **cake offer-pricing + catalog + inventory + stats** web app
(FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Jinja/HTMX + Pico.css, Python 3.14, `uv`). Sibling of the
public **cake-order** app; deployed to a k3s HomeLab via the **ArgoCD** repo,
reached behind **Authentik** forward-auth (not public). Full detail:
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md); overview: [`README.md`](README.md);
annotated DDL: [`schema.sql`](schema.sql). Spec lives in a **private**
`PLANNING.md` (the `§` refs) — not in this repo.

## Commands

```bash
uv sync
# DB is required for most of the app and its tests:
podman run -d --name cakepricingpg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=devpass -e POSTGRES_USER=cake \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=cake-pricing -p 55434:5432 postgres:18
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql+psycopg://cake:devpass@localhost:55434/cake-pricing"
uv run alembic upgrade head

uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload      # :8000 → /offers
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy
uv run pytest                             # single: uv run pytest tests/test_stats.py -q
uv run pytest -k "not browser"            # skip Playwright tests
uv run playwright install --with-deps chromium   # once, for browser tests
```

If `uv run` is flaky under pyenv, use `.venv/bin/…`. If mypy's incremental cache
throws a disk error, run `mypy --no-incremental --cache-dir=/dev/null`. Under
heavy machine load, test/mypy startup can be very slow — wait rather than assume a
hang.

## Architecture in one screen

- **Temporal pricing is the core idea.** Component prices have non-overlapping
  time windows; an offer is priced with the price valid on **its own
  `entry_date`**. **Cost is never stored** — it's computed by SQL views
  (`v_offer_line_cost`, `v_offer_cost`) mirrored in
  [`app/services/pricing.py`](app/services/pricing.py).
- **9 tables** ([`app/models.py`](app/models.py) / [`schema.sql`](schema.sql)):
  `groups`, `components`, `component_prices` (append-only), `customers`,
  `offers`, `offer_components`, `recipes`/`recipe_items`, `stock_movements`
  (append-only), `price_sync_state` (singleton).
- Routers under `app/routers/` (one per domain area); services under
  `app/services/`; the external write path is
  [`app/routers/intake.py`](app/routers/intake.py) (`POST /api/intake/offers`,
  bearer token) — cake-order calls it to create external draft offers.
- **Daily price sync**: a CronJob runs
  [`app/jobs/price_sync.py`](app/jobs/price_sync.py) (`python -m
  app.jobs.price_sync`) — downloads the árfigyelő XLSX, updates component base
  prices via the temporal mechanism, e-mails a report, and records
  `price_sync_state.last_success_at` (a `/metrics` gauge for staleness alerts).
- **Calendar**: [`app/routers/calendar.py`](app/routers/calendar.py) — `/schedule`
  month view + the tokenized `/calendar/{token}/offers.ics` feed.
- **Recipes** (Receptek): [`app/routers/recipes.py`](app/routers/recipes.py) —
  `/recipes` reusable line sets. Note the router module is `recipes.py` but the
  Jinja dir is `app/templates/recipes/`; the ORM models are `Recipe`/`RecipeItem`
  ("template/Sablon" was the old UI name — never reintroduce it). "Save as recipe"
  from the offer form strips the **Alap** (base-cost) group.

## Conventions & invariants (don't break these)

- **Never store cost.** Query `v_offer_cost` / use `pricing.py`. `entry_date` is
  the immutable pricing anchor; external drafts stay `entry_date = NULL` until the
  chef first saves them (intake writes an explicit SQL `NULL`, not Python `None`).
- **Append-only tables** (`component_prices`, `stock_movements`): correct by
  inserting a new row (new window / correction movement), never update in place.
  A price change (manual or the sync job) closes the open window (`expiration_date
  = now`) and inserts a new one — see `change_price` / `price_sync._apply_price_change`.
- **Hungarian numbers**: amount/price inputs are `type=text inputmode=decimal`,
  parsed by `decimal_hu()` in `_helpers.py` (comma + spaces); the `amount` filter
  trims trailing zeros for display.
- **Machines use tokens, humans use Authentik**: the `.ics` feed is token-gated in
  the app AND its `/calendar/` IngressRoute rule skips Authentik. Any new
  machine-accessed endpoint carrying customer data must do the same.
- **`.venv/bin/…` for tools; `uv lock` after editing deps (incl. after a version
  bump — the lock records the package version).**
- **Release/version bump** (deploy is now Helm-chart-based, not raw manifests):
  bump `pyproject.toml` + `app/__init__.py`, run `uv lock`, then bump the container
  image tag in **both** `../homelab-charts/charts/cake-pricing/values.yaml` and
  `../ArgoCD/apps/cake-pricing/values.yaml` (key `image.tag`; single source of
  truth — Chart.yaml has no appVersion). One tag drives the Deployment, migrate
  Job, and price-sync CronJob. A semver git tag builds/pushes the image; Renovate
  in ArgoCD then syncs it. Run the full gate set before committing.
- **`see_other()` after every write** (commit-before-redirect); the intake API
  **commits before its 201** because cake-order marks its order forwarded on that
  ack.
- **HTMX dual-return**: list routes return full HTML normally, the `_rows`/section
  partial when `HX-Request` is set. Preserve that when adding filters.
- **Raw SQL in `stats.py`** is intentional; interpolate only module constants /
  the fixed `flavor`/`theme` identifiers, and always **bind** user values. Use
  `CAST(:year AS INTEGER)` (not `:year::int`, which breaks SQLAlchemy binds).
- **Internal app**: inline `<script>`/`onclick` is fine (no strict CSP), unlike
  cake-order.
- **i18n**: user-facing strings via `t()`; add to the Hungarian catalog.
- **CI parity** with cake-order (Postgres service + `alembic upgrade head`), plus
  Playwright Chromium.
- **Python 3.14**: parenless `except A, B:` (PEP 758) is valid; ruff removing the
  parens is correct.
